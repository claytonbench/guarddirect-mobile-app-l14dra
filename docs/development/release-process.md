## Release Execution

This section details the step-by-step process for executing a release, from creating the release branch to deploying to production.

### Release Branch Creation

For major and minor releases, a release branch is created from the main branch:

```bash
# Create a release branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b release/v1.2.0
```

For patch and hotfix releases, the release branch is created from the appropriate tag:

```bash
# Create a hotfix branch
git checkout v1.2.0
git checkout -b hotfix/v1.2.1
```

Final adjustments and version updates are made on the release branch.

### Version Update

Update version numbers in the following files:

1. Mobile app project file: `src/android/SecurityPatrol/SecurityPatrol.csproj`
   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <Version>1.2.0</Version>
     <ApplicationVersion>120</ApplicationVersion>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

2. Backend API project file: `src/backend/SecurityPatrol.API/SecurityPatrol.API.csproj`
   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <Version>1.2.0</Version>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the release notes

Commit these changes to the release branch:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update version to 1.2.0"
```

### Release Tag Creation

Create a Git tag for the release:

```bash
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release version 1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0
```

This tag triggers the release workflow in GitHub Actions.

### Automated Release Process

The release process is automated through the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. This workflow is triggered by the creation of a version tag (v*.*.*) or can be manually triggered with specific parameters.

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Prepare Release**:
   - Generate release notes from commit history
   - Create GitHub release
   - Upload release notes as artifact

2. **Security Validation** (can be skipped for hotfixes):
   - Run dependency vulnerability scan
   - Run static code analysis
   - Verify no critical security issues exist
   - Generate security validation report

3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - Update Azure infrastructure if needed
   - Validate infrastructure deployment
   - Export infrastructure outputs for subsequent jobs

4. **Deploy Backend**:
   - Download backend container artifact
   - Deploy container to Azure App Service
   - Run post-deployment validation tests
   - Update deployment status

5. **Publish Android App**:
   - Download signed APK artifact
   - Prepare app bundle and release notes
   - Upload to Google Play Store
   - Verify successful upload

6. **Send Notifications**:
   - Generate release summary
   - Send email notifications
   - Post release notes to Slack channel
   - Update release documentation

### Manual Release Steps

In case the automated process fails or for environments without CI/CD integration, the following manual steps can be performed:

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Deploy backend services
   cd infrastructure/scripts
   ./deploy-backend.sh -e production -t 1.2.0
   ```

2. **Android App Publishing**:
   - Build and sign the APK using Visual Studio
   - Upload the signed APK to Google Play Console manually
   - Update the release notes and app metadata
   - Submit for review and release

3. **Release Verification**:
   - Perform manual smoke tests on all components
   - Verify monitoring and alerts are properly configured
   - Check logs for any unexpected errors

### Staged Rollout

For major releases, a staged rollout approach is used to minimize risk:

1. **Backend Services**:
   - Deploy to staging slot first
   - Run validation tests against staging slot
   - Swap staging and production slots if tests pass

2. **Android App**:
   - Release to internal testing track first
   - Promote to closed beta testing (10% of users)
   - Gradually increase to 25%, 50%, and 100% of users
   - Monitor crash reports and user feedback at each stage

The staged rollout can be accelerated or slowed based on monitoring data and feedback.

### Release Approval

Before deploying to production, formal approval is required:

1. **Approval Requirements**:
   - Major releases: Product Owner, Development Lead, QA Lead, Operations Lead
   - Minor releases: Product Owner, Development Lead, QA Lead
   - Patch releases: Development Lead, QA Lead
   - Hotfix releases: Development Lead (with post-deployment review)

2. **Approval Process**:
   - Review release notes and test results
   - Verify all quality gates have been passed
   - Confirm rollback plan is in place
   - Provide formal approval in the release management system
   - For GitHub Actions workflow, approve the deployment to production environment

## Release Verification

After deployment, verification steps ensure that the release is functioning correctly in production.

### Smoke Testing

Immediately after deployment, smoke tests verify that the application is functioning correctly:

1. **Backend API Verification**:
   - Verify health check endpoint returns 200 OK

## Release Rollback

Despite thorough testing, issues may still occur in production. This section details the procedures for rolling back a release if necessary.

### Rollback Decision Criteria

The decision to roll back should be based on the following criteria:

1. **Severity of Issues**:
   - Critical functionality is broken
   - Data integrity is compromised
   - Security vulnerability is discovered
   - Performance degradation affects usability

2. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Number of affected users
   - Business impact of the issue
   - Availability of workarounds
   - Time required to fix vs. time to roll back

3. **Decision Authority**:
   - Development Lead can initiate rollback for technical issues
   - Product Owner can initiate rollback for business impact
   - Security Lead can initiate rollback for security vulnerabilities
   - Operations Lead can initiate rollback for infrastructure issues

### Backend Rollback Procedure

To roll back the backend services:

1. **Using Deployment Slots**:
   ```bash
   # Swap back to the previous version
   az webapp deployment slot swap -g securitypatrol-prod-rg -n securitypatrol-api --slot staging --target-slot production
   ```

2. **Using Container Rollback**:
   ```bash
   # Revert to the previous container image
   az webapp config container set -g securitypatrol-prod-rg -n securitypatrol-api --docker-custom-image-name securitypatrol-api:previous-version
   ```

3. **Database Rollback** (if necessary):
   ```bash
   # Restore database from point-in-time backup
   az sql db restore -g securitypatrol-prod-rg -s securitypatrol-sql -n securitypatrol-db --dest-name securitypatrol-db-restored --time "2023-07-01T00:00:00Z"
   ```

4. **Verification After Rollback**:
   - Verify API health check endpoint
   - Test key functionality
   - Verify database connectivity
   - Check logs for errors

### Mobile App Rollback Procedure

Rolling back a mobile app is more challenging since users have already installed the new version. The following approaches can be used:

1. **Google Play Staged Rollout**:
   - If using staged rollout, halt the rollout immediately
   - Revert to the previous version in Google Play Console
   - Users who haven't updated will receive the previous version

2. **Server-Side Feature Flags**:
   - Disable problematic features via server-side configuration
   - This allows quick mitigation without requiring app updates

3. **Emergency Patch Release**:
   - If rollback is not possible, prepare an emergency patch
   - Expedite the release process for critical fixes
   - Communicate with users about the issue and upcoming fix

4. **User Communication**:
   - Notify users of known issues
   - Provide workarounds if available
   - Set expectations for resolution timeline

### Infrastructure Rollback Procedure

For infrastructure changes that need to be rolled back:

1. **Using Terraform**:
   ```bash
   # Roll back to previous infrastructure state
   cd infrastructure/terraform
   terraform workspace select production
   terraform plan -out=rollback.tfplan -var-file=environments/prod/terraform.tfvars -target=module.specific_resource
   terraform apply rollback.tfplan
   ```

2. **Manual Resource Restoration**:
   - For critical issues, restore resources manually in Azure Portal
   - Document all manual changes for later reconciliation with IaC

3. **Verification After Rollback**:
   - Verify resource health and connectivity
   - Check dependent services
   - Verify monitoring and alerts are functioning

### Post-Rollback Actions

After a rollback, the following actions should be taken:

1. **Incident Documentation**:
   - Document the issue that led to rollback
   - Record the rollback process and timeline
   - Document any data or configuration changes

2. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Investigate the underlying cause of the issue
   - Identify how it passed through testing
   - Determine process improvements to prevent recurrence

3. **Recovery Plan**:
   - Develop a plan to fix the issue
   - Create a timeline for re-releasing the fixed version
   - Implement additional testing for the affected area

4. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Notify all stakeholders of the rollback
   - Provide clear explanation of the issue and impact
   - Share the recovery plan and timeline
