# Security Patrol Application - Coding Standards

## Introduction

This document defines the coding standards, conventions, and best practices for the Security Patrol application. Following these standards ensures code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase. These standards apply to both the .NET MAUI mobile application and the backend API components.

All developers contributing to the Security Patrol application are expected to adhere to these standards. Code reviews should verify compliance with these standards before approving pull requests.

## General Principles

The following general principles guide our coding standards:

### Readability and Maintainability
- Write code that is easy to read and understand
- Prioritize clarity over cleverness
- Consider future maintainers when writing code
- Follow consistent patterns and conventions
- Keep methods and classes focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful names that convey intent

### Code Quality
- Follow SOLID principles of object-oriented design
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Minimize code duplication (DRY principle)
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Maintain high code coverage for critical components
- Use static analysis tools to identify issues
- Address warnings and code smells promptly

### Performance and Security
- Consider performance implications, especially for mobile devices

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Write clear commit messages and pull request descriptions

## Code Style and Formatting

The Security Patrol application uses automated tools to enforce consistent code style and formatting. These rules are defined in the `.editorconfig` file and StyleCop configuration.

### Indentation and Spacing
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in XML, JSON, and YAML files
- Use a single space after keywords in control flow statements
- Use a single space around binary operators
- Do not use spaces inside parentheses
- Use a single space after commas in argument lists
- Use a single blank line to separate logical groups of code
- Limit lines to 120 characters where possible
- Avoid trailing whitespace

### Braces and Line Breaks
- Place opening braces on a new line (Allman style)
- Always use braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks
- Place `else`, `catch`, and `finally` keywords on a new line
- Place each member of an object initializer on a new line
- Place each query clause in LINQ queries on a new line
- Do not use single-line blocks for control structures
- Use single-line methods only for simple property accessors or very simple methods

### Code Organization
- Organize using directives at the top of the file, outside the namespace
- Place system using directives first, followed by other namespaces
- Sort using directives alphabetically within each group
- Organize members in a consistent order: fields, constructors, properties, methods
- Within each member group, order by accessibility: public, internal, protected, private
- Place static members before instance members
- Group related members together
- Limit file length to 1000 lines where possible; consider refactoring larger files

### Comments and Documentation
- Use XML documentation comments for all public members
- Begin comments with a capital letter and end with a period
- Use `//` for single-line comments, not `/* */`
- Place comments on a separate line, not at the end of a code line
- Use XML tags appropriately: `<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`, `<exception>`, `<remarks>`
- Include the company name and copyright in file headers
- Document parameter validation and exceptions that may be thrown

### XAML Formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in XAML files
- Place each attribute on a separate line for elements with multiple attributes
- Order attributes consistently: x:Name, x:Key, Style, other attached properties, local properties
- Use self-closing tags for elements without content
- Use consistent naming for resources
- Group related resources together
- Use StaticResource markup extension for resource references
- Use proper namespace prefixes for all XAML elements

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions improve code readability and maintainability. Follow these naming conventions for all code in the Security Patrol application.

### General Naming Guidelines
- Use meaningful, descriptive names that convey intent
- Prefer clarity over brevity
- Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless widely understood
- Use consistent terminology throughout the codebase
- Avoid using language keywords as names
- Do not use Hungarian notation
- Do not include the parent class name in a property name (e.g., use `Name` not `CustomerName` for a property of the `Customer` class)

### Casing Conventions
- Use PascalCase for namespace, class, record, struct, enum, interface, method, property, and event names
- Use camelCase for parameter, local variable, and private field names
- Use PascalCase for public and protected fields (avoid public fields when possible)
- Use PascalCase for constant names
- Use ALL_UPPERCASE for compile-time constants only when they represent external system values
- Use camelCase for private and internal static fields
- Prefix interface names with 'I' (e.g., `IRepository`)
- Do not prefix enum names with 'E' or any other letter

### File Naming
- Name source files according to the primary class they contain
- Use PascalCase for file names
- Use consistent suffixes for specific types of classes:
  - *Controller for API controllers
  - *Service for service classes
  - *Repository for repository classes
  - *ViewModel for view model classes
  - *Page for XAML pages
  - *View for XAML views
  - *Tests for test classes
- Place interfaces and implementations in separate files (e.g., `IUserService.cs` and `UserService.cs`)

### Specific Naming Conventions
- **Namespaces**: Use the company name followed by the product name and logical grouping (e.g., `SecurityPatrol.Core.Models`)
- **Classes**: Use nouns or noun phrases (e.g., `UserService`, `LocationTracker`)
- **Interfaces**: Use adjective phrases or nouns with 'I' prefix (e.g., `IRepository`, `IDisposable`)
- **Methods**: Use verbs or verb phrases (e.g., `GetUser`, `CalculateTotal`)
- **Properties**: Use nouns, noun phrases, or adjectives (e.g., `FirstName`, `IsEnabled`)
- **Events**: Use verb phrases in past tense (e.g., `Clicked`, `PropertyChanged`)
- **Event Handlers**: Name as [EventName]Handler or On[EventName] (e.g., `ClickHandler`, `OnPropertyChanged`)
- **Boolean Properties and Variables**: Use 'Is', 'Has', 'Can', 'Should' prefixes (e.g., `IsEnabled`, `HasValue`)
- **Asynchronous Methods**: Use 'Async' suffix (e.g., `GetUserAsync`, `SaveChangesAsync`)
- **XAML Elements**: Use descriptive names with appropriate suffixes (e.g., `LoginButton`, `UserNameEntry`)

### Abbreviations and Acronyms
- Treat acronyms as words in names (e.g., `XmlDocument`, not `XMLDocument`)
- Use PascalCase for acronyms in PascalCase contexts (e.g., `HttpClient`)
- Use camelCase for acronyms in camelCase contexts (e.g., `xmlDocument`)
- Exceptions: UI, API, ID, IO can be all uppercase when used as a suffix
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: A class should have only one reason to change
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types

### Class Design
- Keep classes focused on a single responsibility
- Limit class size to 500-1000 lines where possible

### Interface Design
- Design interfaces for specific roles or behaviors
- Keep interfaces focused and cohesive
- Avoid large, monolithic interfaces
- Consider interface segregation for different client needs
- Use consistent naming conventions for interface methods

### Design Patterns
Use appropriate design patterns for common scenarios:

- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: For object creation
- **Strategy Pattern**: For interchangeable algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: For event handling
- **Command Pattern**: For encapsulating operations
- **Decorator Pattern**: For adding behavior dynamically
- **Adapter Pattern**: For interface compatibility
- **Singleton Pattern**: For single instance objects (use with caution)
