## Development Workflow

The Security Patrol application follows a structured development workflow to ensure code quality, maintainability, and collaboration. This section outlines the key aspects of this workflow.

### Branching Strategy

We follow a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code, tagged with release versions
- `develop`: Integration branch for features, primary development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches for critical production issues

Branch naming convention:
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/issue-description`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/vX.Y.Z`

Workflow:
1. Create a feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement the feature with regular commits
3. Create a pull request to merge back to `develop`
4. After review and approval, merge the feature branch
5. Delete the feature branch after merging

### Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Issues (or Azure DevOps) for issue tracking:

1. All development work should be associated with an issue
2. Issues should have clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, and labels
3. Reference issue numbers in commit messages and pull requests
4. Update issue status as work progresses

Issue types:
- Feature: New functionality or enhancements
- Bug: Issues with existing functionality
- Task: Development tasks that aren't features or bugs
- Documentation: Documentation updates or improvements

### Commit Guidelines

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

1. Use the conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Example: `feat(auth): implement phone verification`

2. Write clear and concise messages in present tense
   - Good: `fix(location): resolve GPS tracking issue in background`
   - Avoid: `Fixed a bug`

3. Reference issue numbers when applicable
   - Example: `feat(patrol): add checkpoint verification #123`

4. Keep commits focused on a single change

5. Commit frequently with logical units of work

### Pull Request Process

Follow these steps for pull requests:

1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to `develop`

2. Include in the description:
   - Summary of changes
   - Issue references
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots or videos for UI changes

3. Request reviews from appropriate team members

4. Address review feedback with additional commits

5. Ensure all checks pass (builds, tests, code analysis)

6. Merge using squash merge or rebase merge as per project convention

7. Delete the feature branch after merging

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, focus on the following aspects:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code correctly implement the requirements?

2. **Architecture**: Does the code follow the established architectural patterns?

3. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

- Implement Dependency Injection for loosely coupled components
- Apply the Strategy pattern for varying algorithms
- Use the Observer pattern for event handling
- Implement the Command pattern for user actions
- Apply the Factory pattern for object creation
- Use the Adapter pattern for integrating with external systems

### General Principles

- Keep it simple: Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY): Extract common code
- You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI): Don't add features until needed
- Separation of concerns: Each component should have a clear responsibility
- Interface segregation: Define focused interfaces
- Dependency inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations
- Fail fast: Validate inputs and preconditions early
- Defensive programming: Handle edge cases and exceptions gracefully

## Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions for common issues you might encounter during development.
