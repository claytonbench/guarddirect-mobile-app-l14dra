```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mobile Application"
        UI[UI Layer]-->|User Input|VM[ViewModel Layer]
        VM-->|Commands|SVC[Service Layer]
        SVC-->|CRUD Operations|REPO[Repository Layer]
        REPO-->|Persistence|DB[(Local Storage)]
        SVC-->|API Calls|API[API Service]
        SYNC[Sync Service]-->|Background Sync|REPO
        SYNC-->|API Calls|API
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        API-->|HTTP Requests|GATEWAY[API Gateway]
        GATEWAY-->|Route Requests|BACKEND[Backend Services]
        BACKEND-->|Store Data|CLOUD[(Cloud Storage)]
    end
    
    DB<-->|Bidirectional Sync|CLOUD
```

6. API Service handles communication with backend APIs
7. Backend services process requests and store data in cloud storage

For more detailed information on data flows, see [Data Flow Documentation](data-flow.md).

## Mobile Application Architecture

The mobile application is built using .NET MAUI, primarily targeting Android devices. It implements a layered architecture with the MVVM pattern for separation of UI and business logic.

### Architectural Layers

The mobile application is structured into the following layers:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Presentation Layer] --> B[ViewModel Layer]
    B --> C[Service Layer]
    C --> D[Repository Layer]
    D --> E[Data Access Layer]
    C --> F[Device Integration Layer]
```

1. **Presentation Layer**: XAML-based UI components (Views)
2. **ViewModel Layer**: MVVM implementation using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
4. **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction
5. **Data Access Layer**: SQLite and secure file storage implementation
6. **Device Integration Layer**: Access to device capabilities (GPS, camera)

This layered approach provides clear separation of concerns and facilitates testing and maintenance.

### MVVM Implementation

The application uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern to separate UI concerns from business logic, leveraging the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm package for implementation.

Key aspects of the MVVM implementation include:

- **BaseViewModel**: Common base class for all ViewModels providing shared functionality
- **View-ViewModel Binding**: XAML data binding for UI updates

    User ||--o{ LocationRecord : "generates"
    User ||--o{ Photo : "captures"
    User ||--o{ ActivityReport : "creates"
    User ||--o{ CheckpointVerification : "completes"
    
    PatrolLocation ||--o{ Checkpoint : "contains"
    Checkpoint ||--o{ CheckpointVerification : "verified by"
    
    SyncQueue ||--o{ TimeRecord : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ LocationRecord : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ Photo : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ ActivityReport : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ CheckpointVerification : "tracks"
```

This model captures the core entities and their relationships, supporting the key functional requirements of the application.

### Data Persistence Strategy

    A --> O
    D --> O
    D --> P
    A --> Q
    D --> Q
    M --> Q
    Q --> R
```

    participant App
    participant API
    participant SMS

    User->>App: Enter Phone Number
    App->>API: POST /auth/verify (phone)
    API->>SMS: Request Verification Code
    SMS-->>User: SMS with Code
    User->>App: Enter Verification Code
    App->>API: POST /auth/validate (code)
    API-->>App: JWT Access & Refresh Tokens
    App->>App: Store Tokens in Secure Storage
    App-->>User: Authentication Complete

    Note over App,API: Token Refresh Flow
    App->>App: Detect Token Expiring
    App->>API: POST /auth/refresh
    API-->>App: New Access Token
    App->>App: Update Stored Token
```

This approach provides two-factor authentication (something the user has - the phone, and something they know - the verification code) while maintaining a good user experience.
