## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance on the alert system for the Security Patrol application. It covers alert configuration, notification channels, response procedures, and best practices to ensure timely detection and resolution of issues.

Effective alerting is essential for maintaining the reliability, performance, and security of the Security Patrol application. This document serves as a reference for operations teams, developers, and stakeholders responsible for monitoring and responding to alerts.

## Alert Architecture

The Security Patrol application implements a comprehensive alert architecture that spans all components of the system, from backend infrastructure to the mobile application.

### Alert Sources

Alerts are generated from multiple sources throughout the application ecosystem:

1. **Azure Monitor Alerts**:
   - Resource health and availability
   - Performance metrics (CPU, memory, etc.)
   - Capacity thresholds
   - Service health notifications

2. **Application Insights Alerts**:
   - API response time
   - Request failure rate
   - Exception volume
   - Availability test failures
   - Custom metric thresholds

3. **Log Analytics Alerts**:
   - Complex query-based alerts
   - Pattern detection
   - Correlation rules
   - Security and compliance alerts

4. **App Center Alerts**:
   - Mobile app crash rate
   - Critical error events
   - Performance degradation
   - Usage anomalies

5. **Custom Application Alerts**:
   - Business process failures
   - Data integrity issues
   - Security events
   - Integration failures

### Alert Flow

The flow of alerts through the system follows this pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Alert Sources"
        A[Azure Monitor] --> F[Alert Processing]
        B[Application Insights] --> F
        C[Log Analytics] --> F
        D[App Center] --> F
        E[Custom Application] --> F
    end
    
    subgraph "Alert Processing"
        F --> G[Alert Manager]
        G --> H{Severity Routing}
    end
    
    subgraph "Notification Channels"
        H -->|Critical| I[SMS + Email + Teams]
        H -->|High| J[Email + Teams]
        H -->|Medium| K[Email]
        H -->|Low| L[Dashboard Only]
    end
    
    subgraph "Response"
        I --> M[Immediate Response]
        J --> N[Prioritized Response]
        K --> O[Scheduled Response]
        L --> P[Informational]
    end
    
    subgraph "Tracking"
        M --> Q[Incident Management]
        N --> Q
        O --> Q
        P --> R[Monitoring Dashboard]
    end
```

This architecture ensures that alerts are properly routed based on severity and impact, with appropriate notification channels and response procedures.

### Alert Severity Levels

Alerts are categorized into severity levels to ensure appropriate response:

| Severity | Level | Description | Response Time | Notification Channels |
|----------|-------|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Critical | 1 | Service outage or severe degradation affecting all users | Immediate (< 15 min) | SMS, Email, Teams, Phone Call |
| High | 2 | Partial service degradation or affecting a subset of users | < 1 hour | Email, Teams |
| Medium | 3 | Non-critical issues with limited user impact | < 4 hours | Email |
| Low | 4 | Informational alerts with no immediate impact | Next business day | Dashboard only |

Severity levels are assigned based on the potential impact to users and business operations. The severity level determines the notification channels, response time expectations, and escalation procedures.

### Alert Grouping

To prevent alert fatigue, related alerts are grouped using these strategies:

1. **Smart Groups**:
   - Azure Monitor Smart Groups automatically correlate related alerts
   - Groups are formed based on occurrence pattern, resource type, and proximity
   - Single notification for multiple related alerts
   - Consolidated view in the Azure portal

2. **Alert Suppression**:
   - Duplicate alerts suppressed during maintenance windows
   - Flapping detection to prevent repeated alerts for unstable conditions
   - Cooldown periods between similar alerts
   - Correlation rules to prevent cascade alerts

3. **Alert Aggregation**:
   - Threshold for number of occurrences before notification
   - Time window for aggregating similar alerts
   - Summary notifications for grouped alerts
   - Digest format for low-priority alerts

Alert grouping is configured in Azure Monitor and through custom Logic Apps workflows to ensure efficient notification without overwhelming responders.

## Alert Response Procedures

This section details the procedures for responding to alerts of different types and severity levels.

### Alert Response Workflow

The general workflow for responding to alerts follows these steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Alert Triggered] --> B[Initial Assessment]
    B --> C{Severity Level?}
    
    C -->|Critical| D[Immediate Response]
    C -->|High| E[Prioritized Response]
    C -->|Medium| F[Scheduled Response]
    C -->|Low| G[Informational]
    
    D --> H[Acknowledge Alert]
    E --> H
    F --> H
    
    H --> I[Investigate Root Cause]
    I --> J[Implement Resolution]
    J --> K[Verify Resolution]
    K --> L[Document Incident]
    L --> M[Post-Incident Review]
```

**Initial Assessment:**
- Verify alert is valid (not a false positive)
- Confirm severity and impact
- Determine if related to known issues or maintenance
- Assign to appropriate responder

**Response Based on Severity:**
- **Critical (Sev 1)**: Immediate response required, all other work paused
- **High (Sev 2)**: Response within 1 hour, prioritized over routine work
- **Medium (Sev 3)**: Response within 4 hours, scheduled appropriately
- **Low (Sev 4)**: Informational, addressed during normal operations

**Resolution Process:**
- Acknowledge alert in monitoring system
- Investigate root cause using monitoring tools and logs
- Implement appropriate resolution steps
- Verify issue is resolved and services are functioning normally
- Document the incident, cause, and resolution
- Schedule post-incident review for critical and high severity alerts
