   - Tap "Submit" to save the report
   - Reports are stored locally and synchronized with the backend

## Offline Operation

The application is designed to work offline with the following capabilities:

- **Authentication**: Initial authentication requires connectivity, but subsequent sessions use cached tokens
- **Clock In/Out**: Full offline support with local storage of clock events
- **Location Tracking**: Continues tracking even without connectivity
- **Photo Capture**: Photos can be taken and stored locally when offline
- **Activity Reports**: Reports can be created and stored locally when offline
- **Patrol Management**: Requires initial download of checkpoint data, but verification works offline

All offline data is automatically synchronized with the backend when connectivity is restored.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Ensure you have network connectivity
   - Verify that the correct phone number is entered

# CODE GUIDE

## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the Security Patrol Application codebase. The application is designed for security personnel to track activities, locations, and complete checkpoint-based patrols. It consists of a .NET MAUI mobile application (Android-focused) and a .NET backend API service.

## Project Structure Overview

The Security Patrol Application is organized into several main directories:

- `src/android/` - Mobile application source code (.NET MAUI)
- `src/backend/` - Backend API services (.NET 8)
- `src/test/` - Test projects for both mobile and backend components
- `infrastructure/` - Infrastructure as Code and deployment scripts
- `docs/` - Documentation files including architecture diagrams

## src/android/ - Mobile Application

The mobile application is built using .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) framework, focusing primarily on Android devices. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with a service-oriented approach.

### src/android/SecurityPatrol/MauiProgram.cs

This is the entry point for the .NET MAUI application. It configures the application's services, dependencies, and UI settings.

Key responsibilities:
- Configures the MAUI application with default settings
- Registers services in the dependency injection container
- Configures fonts used in the application
- Registers ViewModels in the dependency injection container
- Sets up logging for debug builds

The file uses dependency injection to register:
- Singleton services (services that should have only one instance throughout the app)
- Transient services (services that are created each time they are requested)
- Scoped services (services that are created once per scope)

### src/android/SecurityPatrol/App.xaml and App.xaml.cs

These files define the application's entry point and global resources. The App class initializes the application, sets up the main page, and handles application lifecycle events.

Key responsibilities:

## Coding Standards

The Security Patrol Application follows strict coding standards to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

### General Principles

- **Readability and Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to read and understand
- **Code Quality**: Follow SOLID principles and write clean, self-documenting code
- **Performance and Security**: Consider performance implications and follow secure coding practices
- **Documentation**: Document public APIs, complex algorithms, and business rules

### Code Style and Formatting

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in C# files (not tabs)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in XML, JSON, and YAML files
- Place opening braces on a new line (Allman style)
- Always use braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks
- Limit lines to 120 characters where possible
- Organize using directives at the top of the file, outside the namespace
- Place system using directives first, followed by other namespaces

### Naming Conventions

- Use **PascalCase** for namespace, class, record, struct, enum, interface, method, property, and event names
- Use **camelCase** for parameter, local variable, and private field names
- Prefix interface names with 'I' (e.g., `IRepository`)
- Use meaningful, descriptive names that convey intent
- Avoid abbreviations and acronyms unless widely understood
- Use consistent terminology throughout the codebase

### Language Usage

- Use C# 10.0 features (latest as of .NET 6.0) or newer
- Enable nullable reference types (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>` in project file)
- Use `var` when the type is obvious from the right side of the assignment
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use expression-bodied members for simple methods and properties
- Validate method parameters and throw appropriate exceptions

### XAML Guidelines

- Use consistent naming for XAML elements
- Use styles and resources for consistent appearance
- Avoid inline styles when possible
- Use data binding with appropriate binding modes
- Use value converters for data transformation
- Implement proper accessibility attributes

## Development Workflow

The Security Patrol application follows a structured development workflow to ensure code quality, maintainability, and collaboration.

### Branching Strategy

We follow a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy:

- `main`: Production-ready code, tagged with release versions
- `develop`: Integration branch for features, primary development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches for issue resolution
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches for critical production issues

Branch naming convention:
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/issue-description`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/vX.Y.Z`

### Commit Guidelines

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

1. Use the conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Example: `feat(auth): implement phone verification`

2. Write clear and concise messages in present tense
   - Good: `fix(location): resolve GPS tracking issue in background`
   - Avoid: `Fixed a bug`

3. Reference issue numbers when applicable
   - Example: `feat(patrol): add checkpoint verification #123`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create a pull request from your feature branch to `develop`
2. Include a comprehensive description with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Issue references
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots or videos for UI changes
3. Request reviews from appropriate team members
4. Address review feedback with additional commits
5. Ensure all checks pass (builds, tests, code analysis)
6. Merge using squash merge or rebase merge as per project convention

### Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, focus on the following aspects:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code correctly implement the requirements?
2. **Architecture**: Does the code follow the established architectural patterns?
3. **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable?
4. **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
5. **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
6. **Testing**: Is the code adequately tested?
7. **Documentation**: Is the code properly documented?

## Testing Requirements

All code changes should include appropriate tests:

### Unit Testing

- Test individual components in isolation

- Focus on critical business flows
- Use Xamarin.UITest for UI automation

### Performance Testing

- Establish baselines for key operations
- Test under various load conditions
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, battery)
- Verify performance meets defined thresholds

### Test Naming Conventions

Use the following naming convention for test methods:

```
[ClassUnderTest]_[MethodUnderTest]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]
```

Examples:
- `AuthenticationService_VerifyCode_WithValidCode_ReturnsTrue`
- `TimeTrackingViewModel_ClockIn_WhenAlreadyClockedIn_ShowsError`

## Architecture Overview

Understanding the architecture of the Security Patrol application is essential for effective development.

### Mobile Application Architecture

The mobile application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with a layered architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: XAML-based UI components (Views)
2. **ViewModel Layer**: MVVM implementation using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
3. **Service Layer**: Business logic and orchestration
4. **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction
5. **Data Access Layer**: SQLite and secure file storage implementation

Key components include:
- Authentication Service for user verification
- Location Service for GPS tracking
- Time Tracking Service for clock in/out operations
- Patrol Service for checkpoint management
- Photo Service for camera integration
- Report Service for activity documentation
- Sync Service for data synchronization

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a clean architecture approach with the following layers:

1. **API Layer**: Controllers and API endpoints
2. **Application Layer**: Application services and business logic
3. **Core Layer**: Domain entities, interfaces, and business rules
4. **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access, external service integration, and infrastructure concerns

### Data Architecture

The data architecture is designed to support offline operation and efficient synchronization:

1. **Local Storage**: SQLite database for structured data and file system for binary data (photos)
2. **Synchronization**: Background synchronization of local data with backend services
3. **Data Model**: Core entities include User, TimeRecord, LocationRecord, Photo, ActivityReport, PatrolLocation, Checkpoint, and CheckpointVerification
4. **Data Flow**: Local-first operations with background synchronization when connectivity is available
5. **Data Security**: Encryption of sensitive data both at rest and in transit

## Release Process

The Security Patrol application follows a structured release process to ensure consistent, reliable, and secure deployments.

### Release Types

- **Major Releases** (1.0.0, 2.0.0): Significant new features or breaking changes
- **Minor Releases** (1.1.0, 1.2.0): New features without breaking changes
- **Patch Releases** (1.1.1, 1.1.2): Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **Hotfix Releases**: Critical fixes for production issues

### Version Numbering

The application follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):

- **Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
- **Major Version**: Incremented for breaking changes
- **Minor Version**: Incremented for new features
- **Patch Version**: Incremented for bug fixes

### Release Workflow

1. **Planning**: Define scope, timeline, and requirements
2. **Development**: Implement features and fixes
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all components
4. **Release Preparation**: Create release branch, update version numbers
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging, then production
6. **Verification**: Verify functionality in production
7. **Monitoring**: Monitor for issues post-release

### Release Automation

The release process is automated through GitHub Actions workflows defined in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. This workflow handles:

1. Release notes generation
2. Security validation
3. Infrastructure deployment
4. Backend deployment
5. Android app publishing
6. Notifications and documentation updates
