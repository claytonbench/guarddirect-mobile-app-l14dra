## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Security Patrol Application follows a client-centric architecture with a mobile-first approach, implementing a layered architecture pattern within the .NET MAUI framework. The system is designed with the following key architectural principles:

- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for Android devices with a focus on battery efficiency and responsive UI
- **Layered Architecture**: Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstraction of data persistence operations for both local storage and API communication
- **MVVM Pattern**: Separation of UI (Views) from business logic (ViewModels) for maintainable code and testability
- **Service-Oriented Integration**: RESTful API communication with backend services for all data synchronization
- **Offline-First Capability**: Local-first data operations with background synchronization for resilience

System boundaries are defined with the mobile application as the primary client, communicating with multiple backend API services for authentication, data synchronization, and patrol management. The application interfaces directly with device hardware (GPS, camera) while maintaining a clear separation between device-specific implementations and business logic.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Authentication Module | User verification and session management | Authentication API, Secure Storage | Token management, session expiration |
| Location Tracking Service | GPS monitoring and location data management | Device GPS, Location API | Battery optimization, background processing |
| Time Tracking Module | Clock in/out management and history | Time Tracking API, Local Database | Accurate timestamps, offline operation |
| Photo Capture Module | Camera access and image management | Device Camera, Photo API | Secure storage, image compression |
| Activity Reporting Module | Report creation and management | Report API, Local Database | Data validation, offline capability |
| Patrol Management Module | Checkpoint verification and patrol tracking | Checkpoint API, Mapping Service | Geofencing accuracy, map rendering performance |
| Data Synchronization Service | Background data synchronization | All APIs, Network Service | Conflict resolution, retry logic |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The application implements a bidirectional data flow between the mobile client and backend services. All user-generated data (clock events, location updates, photos, reports, checkpoint verifications) follows a local-first approach where data is first persisted locally before being synchronized with backend services.

Authentication data flows directly between the client and Authentication API, with tokens stored securely on the device. Location data is continuously collected when the user is clocked in and batched for efficient transmission to the Location API. Clock events, photos, and activity reports are stored locally and synchronized with their respective APIs based on network availability.

Patrol data follows a more complex flow: checkpoint data is retrieved from the Checkpoint API and stored locally, user location is continuously compared against checkpoint coordinates for proximity detection, and verification events are sent to the API when checkpoints are completed.

The system employs SQLite for structured data persistence (clock events, reports, checkpoint status) and secure file storage for binary data (photos). A local cache is maintained for frequently accessed data like authentication state and active patrol information.

#### 5.1.4 External Integration Points

| System Name | Integration Type | Data Exchange Pattern | Protocol/Format | SLA Requirements |
|-------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Authentication API | REST API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JSON | Response < 3s, 99.9% availability |
| Location API | REST API | Batch Upload | HTTPS/JSON | Batch processing < 5s, 99.5% availability |
| Time Tracking API | REST API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JSON | Response < 2s, 99.9% availability |
| Photo Upload API | REST API | Multipart Form Data | HTTPS/Binary | Upload processing < 30s, 99% availability |
| Report API | REST API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JSON | Response < 2s, 99.5% availability |
| Checkpoint API | REST API | Request-Response | HTTPS/JSON | Response < 3s, 99.5% availability |
| Mapping Service | SDK Integration | Client-Side Rendering | HTTPS/Tiles | Tile loading < 1s, 99.9% availability |

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision | Selected Approach | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Application Architecture | Layered Architecture with MVVM | Monolithic, Clean Architecture | Provides clear separation of concerns while maintaining simplicity for a mobile application |
| Communication Pattern | RESTful API with JSON | GraphQL, gRPC | REST provides simplicity, wide support, and compatibility with existing backend services |
| Offline Strategy | Local-First with Background Sync | Online-Only, Offline-First with Manual Sync | Balances user experience in poor connectivity with data integrity requirements |
| UI Pattern | MVVM | MVC, MVP | MVVM provides better testability and is well-supported by .NET MAUI frameworks |

The layered architecture with MVVM pattern was selected to provide a clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access while maintaining simplicity appropriate for a mobile application. This approach aligns well with .NET MAUI's design principles and facilitates code reuse and testability.

The local-first approach with background synchronization was chosen to ensure the application remains functional in areas with poor connectivity, which is essential for security patrol operations that may occur in remote locations or buildings with limited signal.

        L --> N[Simple implementation]
        L --> O[Compatible with existing systems]
        L --> P[Efficient JSON parsing]
    end
```

#### 5.3.2 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Storage Need | Selected Solution | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| Structured Data | SQLite | Realm, LiteDB | Native support in .NET MAUI, mature ecosystem, SQL familiarity |
| Authentication Tokens | Secure Storage | Encrypted SQLite, Preferences | Platform-specific secure storage mechanisms for sensitive data |
| Images | File System with Encryption | SQLite BLOB, Cloud Storage | Better performance for binary data while maintaining security |
| Temporary Cache | In-Memory Dictionary | SQLite with Cache Table | Performance optimization for frequently accessed data |

SQLite was selected as the primary data storage solution due to its native support in .NET MAUI, small footprint, and ability to handle structured data efficiently. The decision to store images in the file system rather than as BLOBs in SQLite was made to optimize performance, as file system access is generally more efficient for large binary data.

Secure Storage was chosen for authentication tokens to leverage platform-specific security mechanisms, providing an additional layer of protection for sensitive authentication data.

        C --> D{Consequences}
        D --> E[Positive: Optimized for different data types]
        D --> F[Positive: Enhanced security for sensitive data]
        D --> G[Negative: Increased complexity]
        D --> H[Negative: Multiple persistence mechanisms to maintain]
        
        I[Implementation: SQLite + Secure Storage + File System] --> J{Compliance}
        J --> K[Meets security requirements]
        J --> L[Supports offline operation]
        J --> M[Efficient for different data types]
    end
```

#### 5.3.3 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------------|----------------|---------|-----------|
| Authentication State | In-Memory | Quick access to auth status | Session duration |
| Location Cache | In-Memory Queue | Batch processing of location updates | Until successfully synced |
| Checkpoint Data | SQLite | Offline access to patrol information | Until patrol completion |
| Map Tiles | Native Map Control Cache | Reduce bandwidth for map rendering | Application lifecycle |

The caching strategy is designed to balance performance, offline capability, and memory usage. Authentication state is kept in memory for quick access throughout the application, while location data is queued in memory for efficient batch processing before being persisted to SQLite and eventually synchronized with the backend.

Checkpoint data is cached in SQLite to ensure availability even when offline, with a lifecycle tied to patrol completion to prevent unnecessary storage consumption. Map tiles leverage the native caching capabilities of the mapping control to reduce bandwidth usage and improve map rendering performance.

#### 5.3.4 Security Mechanism Selection

| Security Concern | Selected Mechanism | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Authentication | Token-based Authentication | Username/Password, Biometric | Simplifies user experience while maintaining security |
| Data Protection | Platform Secure Storage + Encryption | Custom Encryption, Plain Storage | Leverages platform security features with additional encryption layer |
| API Communication | HTTPS with Certificate Pinning | Plain HTTP, Custom Encryption | Industry standard with additional protection against MITM attacks |
| Sensitive Data | Secure Storage API | Encrypted SQLite, Custom Solution | Platform-optimized secure storage for sensitive information |

Security mechanisms were selected with a focus on balancing security requirements with user experience and development complexity. Token-based authentication provides a streamlined experience while maintaining security, and platform secure storage mechanisms leverage OS-level security features.

HTTPS with certificate pinning was chosen for API communication to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, which is particularly important for a security application handling sensitive location and patrol data.

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The application implements a comprehensive monitoring strategy to ensure reliability and performance:

- **Application Insights Integration**: Telemetry collection for performance monitoring and usage analytics
- **Crash Reporting**: Automated crash reporting with stack traces and device information
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracking of key operations (authentication, API calls, map rendering)
- **Usage Analytics**: Anonymous usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities
- **Health Checks**: Periodic verification of API connectivity and service health

Monitoring data is collected with user consent and transmitted securely to backend analytics services. Critical errors trigger immediate alerts to the development team, while performance metrics are aggregated for trend analysis.

#### 5.4.2 Logging and Tracing Strategy

| Log Level | Usage | Storage Location | Retention |
|-----------|-------|------------------|-----------|
| Error | Exceptions, critical failures | Local + Remote | 30 days |
| Warning | Potential issues, degraded functionality | Local + Remote | 14 days |
| Information | Key user actions, state transitions | Local | 7 days |
| Debug | Detailed operation information | Local (dev only) | Session only |

The logging strategy employs a structured logging approach with contextual information (user ID, session ID, device information) attached to each log entry. Logs are stored locally with size-based rotation and uploaded to remote logging services when network is available.

Tracing is implemented for complex operations (patrol verification, synchronization) to provide end-to-end visibility into system behavior. Trace context is maintained across asynchronous operations to enable correlation of related events.

#### 5.4.3 Error Handling Patterns

The application implements a layered error handling approach:

- **UI Layer**: User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- **ViewModel Layer**: Error aggregation and transformation for presentation
- **Service Layer**: Business logic error handling and recovery attempts
- **Repository Layer**: Data access error handling and fallback strategies
- **API Layer**: Network error handling with retry policies

Common error scenarios are handled with specific recovery strategies:

- **Network Connectivity Issues**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Authentication Failures**: Token refresh attempt before requiring re-authentication
- **Data Validation Errors**: Clear feedback with field-specific guidance
- **Device Permission Denials**: Contextual explanation and settings navigation

    G --> V[Operation Complete]
    I --> V
    M --> V
    N --> V
    P --> V
    R --> V
    U --> V
```

#### 5.4.4 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The authentication framework is built around phone number verification with the following components:

- **Authentication Service**: Manages verification process and token lifecycle
- **Token Manager**: Handles secure storage and retrieval of authentication tokens
- **Authorization Filter**: Ensures protected operations require valid authentication
- **Session Monitor**: Tracks session activity and handles timeouts

The authorization model is simplified for this application, with a single user role (security personnel) and authorization based on valid authentication. Future extensions could include role-based access control if needed.

Authentication tokens are refreshed automatically when approaching expiration, and the system handles token revocation scenarios gracefully by redirecting to the login flow.

#### 5.4.5 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Operation | Performance Target | Measurement Method | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Application Startup | < 3 seconds | Cold start timing | Optimized initialization, progressive loading |
| Authentication | < 5 seconds | End-to-end timing | Streamlined verification process |
| Map Rendering | < 2 seconds | Screen load timing | Tile caching, progressive loading |
| Photo Capture | < 1 second | Camera to preview timing | Optimized camera initialization |
| Location Updates | < 15% battery impact per 8-hour shift | Battery usage monitoring | Adaptive polling frequency |
| API Operations | < 2 seconds | Network request timing | Caching, background processing |

The application is designed to meet these performance targets across a range of Android devices, with graceful degradation on lower-end hardware. Performance is monitored continuously through telemetry, with optimization efforts focused on operations that fall below target thresholds.

#### 5.4.6 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The application implements several mechanisms to ensure data integrity and recovery:

- **Data Backup**: Automatic backup of critical local data to secure cloud storage
- **Synchronization Resilience**: Robust retry mechanisms for failed synchronization
- **Corruption Detection**: Integrity checks on local database with automatic repair
- **Version Rollback**: Ability to restore previous application version if critical issues occur
- **Remote Configuration**: Dynamic configuration to disable problematic features remotely

Recovery procedures are designed to be as automated as possible, with clear user guidance when manual intervention is required. The local-first data approach ensures that even in catastrophic failure scenarios, user data can be recovered from local storage.

#### 6.6.4 Data Models

| Model | Properties | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `LocationModel` | `Id`, `Name`, `Latitude`, `Longitude` | Represents a patrol location |
| `CheckpointModel` | `Id`, `LocationId`, `Name`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `IsVerified` | Represents a patrol checkpoint |
| `PatrolStatus` | `LocationId`, `TotalCheckpoints`, `VerifiedCheckpoints` | Represents patrol completion status |
| `CheckpointStatus` | `CheckpointId`, `IsVerified`, `VerificationTime` | Represents checkpoint verification status |
| `CheckpointProximityEventArgs` | `CheckpointId`, `Distance` | Event arguments for proximity changes |

#### 6.6.5 Proximity Detection Algorithm

The proximity detection algorithm uses efficient distance calculation to determine when a user is within range of a checkpoint:

1. Calculate distance between user location and each checkpoint using Haversine formula
2. Filter checkpoints within specified radius (50 feet)
3. Sort by distance to identify nearest checkpoint
4. Trigger proximity events for nearby checkpoints
5. Update UI to highlight checkpoints within range

    }
    
    ISyncService --> INetworkService : uses
    ISyncService --> ISyncRepository : uses
```

#### 6.7.4 Data Models

| Model | Properties | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `SyncItem` | `EntityType`, `EntityId`, `Priority`, `RetryCount`, `LastAttempt` | Represents an item pending synchronization |
| `SyncResult` | `SuccessCount`, `FailureCount`, `PendingCount`, `EntityResults` | Represents results of a sync operation |

#### 6.7.5 Synchronization Strategy

The synchronization strategy implements a robust approach to data synchronization:

1. **Prioritization**: Critical data (clock events, checkpoint verifications) synchronized first
2. **Batching**: Location data batched for efficient transmission
3. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed synchronization attempts
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Server-wins strategy for conflicting updates
5. **Background Processing**: Synchronization performed in background service
6. **Network Awareness**: Adaptive behavior based on network quality and availability

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

While this mobile application does not employ a microservices architecture, it does utilize a service-oriented approach within the application itself. The application is structured around core services that handle specific responsibilities and communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces.

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies |
|---------|------------------------|------------------|
| Authentication Service | Phone verification and session management | API Service, Secure Storage |
| Location Tracking Service | GPS monitoring and data management | Device GPS, Background Services |
| Time Tracking Service | Clock in/out operations and history | Location Service, Local Database |
| Photo Capture Service | Camera access and image management | Device Camera, Secure File Storage |
| Activity Reporting Service | Report creation and management | Local Database, API Service |
| Patrol Management Service | Checkpoint verification and mapping | Location Service, Map Service |
| Synchronization Service | Background data synchronization | Network Service, All Data Services |

#### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Authentication Service] -->|Authentication State| B[Time Tracking Service]
    A -->|Authentication State| C[Location Tracking Service]
    A -->|Authentication State| D[Photo Capture Service]
    A -->|Authentication State| E[Activity Reporting Service]
    A -->|Authentication State| F[Patrol Management Service]
    
    B -->|Clock Status| C
    B -->|Clock Events| G[Synchronization Service]
    
    C -->|Location Updates| F
    C -->|Location Data| G
    
    D -->|Photo Data| G
    
    E -->|Report Data| G
    
    F -->|Checkpoint Data| G
    
    H[API Service] <-->|HTTP Requests/Responses| G
    
    I[Network Service] -->|Connectivity Status| G
```

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

The application implements robust retry and fallback mechanisms to handle transient failures:

| Mechanism | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Exponential Backoff | Polly retry policies | Gradually increase delay between retry attempts |
| Circuit Breaker | Threshold-based failure detection | Prevent repeated calls to failing services |
| Local Caching | SQLite database | Provide data when backend services are unavailable |
| Offline Mode | Background synchronization | Continue operation without network connectivity |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant Local as Local Storage
    participant API as Backend API
    
    App->>API: API Request
    alt Success
        API-->>App: Success Response
        App->>Local: Update Local Data
    else Network Failure
        API--xApp: Connection Error
        App->>Local: Store Operation for Later
        Note over App,Local: Continue in Offline Mode
    else API Error
        API-->>App: Error Response
        alt Retry Possible
            App->>App: Apply Backoff Delay
            App->>API: Retry Request
        else Max Retries Exceeded
            App->>Local: Store Operation for Manual Retry
            App->>App: Show Error Notification
        end
    end
```

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

As a mobile application, traditional server-side scalability concerns are primarily handled by the backend services. However, the application is designed with client-side scalability considerations to ensure optimal performance across different device capabilities and usage patterns.

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Implementation | Benefit |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Lazy Loading | On-demand resource initialization | Reduced memory footprint and startup time |
| Background Processing | Asynchronous operations | Responsive UI during intensive operations |
| Data Pagination | Chunked data retrieval | Efficient handling of large datasets |
| Adaptive Polling | Context-aware update frequency | Battery and network optimization |

#### Resource Allocation Strategy

The application implements an adaptive resource allocation strategy to optimize performance based on device capabilities and usage patterns:

- **Location Tracking**: Adjusts GPS polling frequency based on movement patterns and battery level
- **Photo Capture**: Dynamically adjusts image compression based on available storage and network conditions
- **Map Rendering**: Adapts map detail level based on device performance capabilities
- **Background Synchronization**: Schedules sync operations based on network quality and data priority

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Resource Optimization Strategy"
        A[Device Monitoring] --> B{Resource Constraints?}
        B -->|Low Battery| C[Reduce Location Polling]
        B -->|Limited Storage| D[Increase Photo Compression]
        B -->|Slow Network| E[Prioritize Critical Data Sync]
        B -->|Low Memory| F[Reduce Map Detail Level]
        
        C --> G[Update Resource Profile]
        D --> G
        E --> G
        F --> G
        
        G --> H[Apply Optimized Settings]
        H --> I[Monitor Application Performance]
        I --> A
    end
```

### 6.1.3 RESILIENCE PATTERNS

The application implements several resilience patterns to ensure reliable operation under various conditions:

#### Fault Tolerance Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Local-First Data Operations | SQLite + API Sync | Ensure functionality during connectivity issues |
| Graceful Degradation | Feature-specific fallbacks | Maintain core functionality when resources are limited |
| Error Isolation | Component-level error handling | Prevent cascading failures across the application |
| State Recovery | Persistent state management | Recover from unexpected termination |

#### Data Redundancy Approach

The application employs a multi-layered data redundancy strategy:

- **Primary Storage**: SQLite database for structured data and file system for binary data
- **Memory Cache**: In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
- **Backend Synchronization**: All critical data synchronized with backend when connectivity is available
- **Automatic Backup**: Periodic backup of critical local data to prevent corruption

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Data Resilience Strategy"
        A[User Action] --> B[In-Memory Operation]
        B --> C[Local Storage]
        C --> D{Network Available?}
        
        D -->|Yes| E[API Synchronization]
        D -->|No| F[Queue for Later Sync]
        
        E -->|Success| G[Mark as Synced]
        E -->|Failure| H[Apply Retry Policy]
        
        F --> I[Background Sync Service]
        H --> I
        
        I --> J{Network Restored?}
        J -->|Yes| E
        J -->|No| K[Continue Queuing]
        
        L[Periodic Integrity Check] --> M{Corruption Detected?}
        M -->|Yes| N[Restore from Backup]
        M -->|No| O[Create New Backup]
    end
```

#### Service Degradation Policies

The application implements progressive service degradation to maintain core functionality under resource constraints:

| Constraint | Degradation Policy | Recovery Trigger |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Low Battery | Reduce location tracking frequency | Battery level above threshold |
| Poor Network | Switch to essential-only synchronization | Network quality improvement |
| Limited Storage | Increase compression, limit new photos | Storage space freed |
| High CPU/Memory Usage | Disable animations, reduce map detail | Resource usage normalization |

### 6.1.4 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The application integrates with multiple backend services through a unified API service layer:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mobile Application"
        A[Authentication Service]
        B[Time Tracking Service]
        C[Location Tracking Service]
        D[Photo Capture Service]
        E[Activity Reporting Service]
        F[Patrol Management Service]
        G[API Service Layer]
        
        A --> G
        B --> G
        C --> G
        D --> G
        E --> G
        F --> G
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        H[Authentication API]
        I[Time Tracking API]
        J[Location API]
        K[Photo Upload API]
        L[Report API]
        M[Checkpoint API]
    end
    
    G --> H
    G --> I
    G --> J
    G --> K
    G --> L
    G --> M
```

The API Service Layer provides a unified interface for all backend communication, implementing:

- Authentication token management
- Request/response serialization
- Error handling and retry logic
- Connectivity monitoring
- Request queuing for offline operation

This architecture allows the application to maintain a consistent communication pattern while isolating the individual services from the complexities of network communication.

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

### 6.2.1 SCHEMA DESIGN

The application uses SQLite as the primary local database for structured data storage, with secure file storage for binary data such as photos. The database schema is designed to support offline-first operations with synchronization capabilities.

#### Entity Relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ TimeRecord : "tracks"
    User ||--o{ LocationRecord : "generates"
    User ||--o{ Photo : "captures"
    User ||--o{ ActivityReport : "creates"
    User ||--o{ CheckpointVerification : "completes"
    
    PatrolLocation ||--o{ Checkpoint : "contains"
    Checkpoint ||--o{ CheckpointVerification : "verified by"
    
    SyncQueue ||--o{ TimeRecord : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ LocationRecord : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ Photo : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ ActivityReport : "tracks"
    SyncQueue ||--o{ CheckpointVerification : "tracks"
```

### 6.2.2 DATA MANAGEMENT

#### Migration Procedures

The application implements a version-based migration strategy to handle schema changes:

1. Each database version is assigned an incremental version number
2. Migration scripts are defined for each version transition
3. On application startup, the current database version is checked
4. If migrations are needed, they are applied sequentially
5. Migrations are atomic and include rollback capabilities

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Application Start] --> B{Database Exists?}
    B -->|No| C[Create Database Schema]
    B -->|Yes| D{Current Version < App Version?}
    D -->|No| E[Normal Operation]
    D -->|Yes| F[Begin Migration Process]
    F --> G[Backup Current Database]
    G --> H[Apply Migrations Sequentially]
    H --> I{Migration Successful?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Update Schema Version]
    I -->|No| K[Restore from Backup]
    J --> E
    K --> L[Log Error]
    L --> M[Continue with Previous Version]
    C --> E
    M --> E
```

#### Versioning Strategy

| Version | Changes | Migration Actions |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| 1.0 | Initial schema | Create all tables |
| 1.1 | Add SyncProgress to Photo | ALTER TABLE Photo ADD COLUMN SyncProgress INTEGER DEFAULT 0 |
| 1.2 | Add RemoteId to all tables | ALTER TABLE operations for each table |
| 1.3 | Add ErrorMessage to SyncQueue | ALTER TABLE SyncQueue ADD COLUMN ErrorMessage TEXT |

#### Archival Policies

| Data Type | Retention Period | Archival Trigger | Cleanup Action |

| LocationRecord | 30 days | Age + Synced Status | Delete records older than 30 days if synced |
| TimeRecord | 90 days | Age + Synced Status | Delete records older than 90 days if synced |
| Photo | 30 days | Age + Synced Status + Storage Pressure | Delete oldest synced photos when storage is low |
| ActivityReport | 90 days | Age + Synced Status | Delete records older than 90 days if synced |
| CheckpointVerification | 90 days | Age + Synced Status | Delete records older than 90 days if synced |
| SyncQueue | 7 days | Age + Completion Status | Delete successful sync records older than 7 days |

#### Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms

The application implements a repository pattern for data access with the following components:

1. **Repository Interfaces**: Define data access contracts for each entity
2. **SQLite Implementations**: Concrete implementations using SQLite-net-pcl
3. **Unit of Work**: Coordinates transactions across multiple repositories
4. **Query Objects**: Encapsulate complex query logic
5. **Mappers**: Convert between domain models and database entities

```mermaid

    A[Application Services] --> B[Repository Interfaces]
    B --> C[SQLite Implementations]
    C --> D[SQLite Database]
    
    E[Unit of Work] --> B

```

#### Caching Policies

| Data Type | Cache Strategy | Invalidation Trigger | Storage Location |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| User | Keep in memory | Logout or token expiry | Memory |
| PatrolLocation | Cache after fetch | Manual refresh or 24-hour timeout | SQLite |
| Checkpoint | Cache after fetch | Manual refresh or 24-hour timeout | SQLite |
| TimeRecord (recent) | Cache after fetch | New clock event or sync | Memory + SQLite |
| LocationRecord | Batch processing | Batch size threshold or timer | Memory queue → SQLite |
| ActivityReport (recent) | Cache after fetch | New report or sync | Memory + SQLite |

### 6.2.3 COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS

#### Data Retention Rules

| Data Category | Retention Period | Justification | Implementation |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Authentication Data | Session only | Security best practice | In-memory only, not persisted |
| Location History | 30 days | Operational needs | Automatic purging via scheduled job |
| Time Records | 90 days | Operational needs | Automatic purging via scheduled job |
| Photos | 30 days | Storage optimization | Automatic purging via scheduled job |
| Activity Reports | 90 days | Operational needs | Automatic purging via scheduled job |
| Patrol Verifications | 90 days | Operational needs | Automatic purging via scheduled job |

#### Backup and Fault Tolerance Policies

The application implements a multi-layered backup strategy:

1. **Automatic Database Backup**: Created before migrations or major operations
2. **Scheduled Backups**: Daily backup of critical data
3. **Pre-Sync Snapshots**: Temporary backups before large synchronization operations
4. **Corruption Detection**: Regular integrity checks with automatic repair
5. **Recovery Mechanism**: Ability to restore from most recent valid backup

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Database Operation] --> B{Critical Operation?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Create Backup]
    B -->|No| D[Proceed with Operation]
    C --> D
    
    E[Scheduled Task] --> F[Daily Backup]
    
    G[Integrity Check] --> H{Corruption Detected?}

    H -->|No| M[Update Last Check Timestamp]
    
    N[Sync Operation] --> O[Create Pre-Sync Snapshot]
    O --> P[Perform Sync]
    P --> Q{Sync Successful?}
    Q -->|Yes| R[Delete Snapshot]
    Q -->|No| S[Evaluate Rollback Need]
    S --> T{Rollback Required?}
    T -->|Yes| U[Restore from Snapshot]
    T -->|No| V[Log Error and Continue]
```

#### Privacy Controls

| Data Type | Privacy Measure | Implementation |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| User Authentication | Secure storage | Platform-specific secure storage for tokens |
| Location Data | Minimization | Store only necessary precision and frequency |
| Photos | Isolation | Store in app-specific directory, not device gallery |
| All Data | Encryption | SQLite encryption for sensitive data |
| All Data | Access Control | Authentication required for all data access |

#### Audit Mechanisms

The application implements comprehensive audit logging:

1. **Authentication Events**: Login attempts, logouts, token refreshes
2. **Data Modifications**: Create, update, delete operations on critical data
3. **Synchronization Events**: Sync attempts, successes, failures
4. **Error Events**: Application errors, database errors, network errors
5. **Usage Patterns**: Feature usage, screen navigation (anonymized)

Audit logs are stored locally with a 30-day retention period and synchronized with backend services when available.

#### Access Controls

| Access Level | Permissions | Implementation |
|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Unauthenticated | Access login screen only | Navigation guards, authentication state |
| Authenticated | Access all app features | Token-based authentication, session management |
| Background Services | Read/write specific data | Internal permission system, service isolation |

### 6.2.4 PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Query Optimization Patterns

The application implements several query optimization patterns:

1. **Eager Loading**: Load related data in single query when appropriate
2. **Projection Queries**: Select only needed columns for specific operations
3. **Paging**: Limit result sets for large data collections
4. **Deferred Execution**: Use lazy loading for expensive operations
5. **Compiled Queries**: Pre-compile frequent queries for better performance

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Access Request] --> B{Large Dataset?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Apply Paging]
    B -->|No| D{Related Data Needed?}
    
    C --> D
    
    D -->|Yes| E{Immediate Need?}
    D -->|No| F[Use Projection Query]
    
    E -->|Yes| G[Use Eager Loading]
    E -->|No| H[Use Lazy Loading]
    
    F --> I[Execute Query]
    G --> I
    H --> I
    
    I --> J{Frequent Query?}
    J -->|Yes| K[Cache Query Plan]
    J -->|No| L[Standard Execution]
    
    K --> M[Return Results]
    L --> M
```

#### Caching Strategy

The application implements a multi-level caching strategy:

| Cache Level | Implementation | Purpose | Invalidation Strategy |
|-------------|----------------|---------|----------------------|
| Memory Cache | In-memory dictionary | Frequently accessed data | Time-based expiration, explicit invalidation |
| Entity Cache | SQLite with cache flags | Recently used entities | LRU eviction, sync-based invalidation |
| Query Cache | Cached query results | Expensive queries | Time-based expiration, data change detection |
| Resource Cache | File system | Binary resources (images, map tiles) | Size-based limits, LRU eviction |

#### Connection Pooling

SQLite connection pooling is implemented to optimize database access:

1. **Single Connection**: Primary database connection maintained throughout app lifecycle
2. **Connection Reuse**: Connection kept open between operations
3. **Transaction Management**: Explicit transaction boundaries for related operations
4. **Connection Recovery**: Automatic recovery from connection failures
5. **Background Connection**: Separate connection for background operations

#### Read/Write Splitting

While SQLite doesn't support true read/write splitting, the application implements logical separation:

1. **Read Operations**: Optimized for minimal locking and maximum concurrency
2. **Write Operations**: Batched where possible to reduce transaction overhead
3. **Background Writes**: Non-critical writes performed in background threads
4. **Priority System**: Critical writes prioritized over background operations
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Optimistic concurrency control for potential conflicts

#### Batch Processing Approach

The application implements batch processing for efficiency:

| Operation | Batch Strategy | Trigger | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|---------|----------------|
| Location Updates | Collect in memory, batch write | 50 records or 60 seconds | Memory queue → SQLite transaction |
| API Synchronization | Group by entity type | Network availability or 15 minutes | Prioritized sync queue |
| Photo Processing | Process in background | Capture completion | Background task queue |
| Database Cleanup | Batch delete operations | Daily or storage pressure | Scheduled maintenance task |

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Location Batch Processing"
        A[Location Update] --> B[Add to Memory Queue]
        B --> C{Queue Threshold?}
        C -->|Yes| D[Begin Database Transaction]
        C -->|No| E{Timer Elapsed?}
        E -->|Yes| D
        E -->|No| B
        D --> F[Write All Records]
        F --> G[Commit Transaction]
        G --> H[Clear Memory Queue]
        H --> I{Network Available?}
        I -->|Yes| J[Queue API Sync]
        I -->|No| K[Schedule Later Sync]
    end
```

### 6.2.6 REPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

While traditional database replication is not applicable to this mobile application, the synchronization system serves as a form of replication between the local SQLite database and backend services.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mobile Device"
        A[SQLite Database]
        B[Sync Service]
        C[File Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        D[API Gateway]
        E[Authentication Service]
        F[Data Services]
        G[Storage Services]
        H[Primary Database]
    end
    
    A <-->|Bidirectional Sync| B
    C <-->|File Sync| B
    
    B <-->|API Calls| D
    D --> E
    D <--> F
    D <--> G
    
    F <--> H
    G <--> H
    
    subgraph "Sync Patterns"
        I[Create/Update/Delete]
        J[Conflict Resolution]
        K[Batch Processing]
        L[Delta Sync]
    end
    
    B --> I
    B --> J
    B --> K
    B --> L
```

The synchronization architecture implements:

1. **Bidirectional Sync**: Changes can originate from either mobile or backend
2. **Conflict Resolution**: Server-wins strategy for conflicting changes
3. **Incremental Sync**: Only changed data is transmitted when possible
4. **Prioritized Sync**: Critical data synchronized first
5. **Resilient Operation**: Continues functioning during connectivity issues

This approach ensures data consistency between the mobile application and backend services while allowing offline operation with eventual consistency.

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

The Security Patrol Application relies heavily on integration with backend services to fulfill its core functionality. This section outlines the integration architecture that enables communication between the mobile application and external systems.

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

#### Protocol Specifications

| Aspect | Specification | Justification |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Protocol | HTTPS | Secure communication for sensitive data |
| Format | JSON | Lightweight, widely supported data format |
| Architecture | RESTful | Stateless, resource-oriented approach |
| Content Type | application/json | Standard content type for JSON payloads |

#### Authentication Methods

| Method | Implementation | Usage |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Token-based | JWT Bearer Token | Primary authentication mechanism |
| SMS Verification | One-time codes | Initial authentication flow |
| Token Refresh | Silent refresh | Maintain session without re-authentication |

The application uses a two-step authentication process:
1. Phone number verification via SMS code
2. JWT token issuance upon successful verification
3. Token included in Authorization header for subsequent requests

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant Auth as Auth API
    participant SMS as SMS Service
    participant Backend as Backend Services
    
    App->>Auth: POST /auth/verify (phone number)
    Auth->>SMS: Request verification code
    SMS-->>Auth: Code generated
    Auth-->>App: Return verification ID
    
    App->>Auth: POST /auth/validate (verification ID, code)
    Auth->>Auth: Validate code
    Auth-->>App: Return JWT token
    
    App->>Backend: API Request with Bearer token
    Backend->>Backend: Validate token
    Backend-->>App: Protected resource response
    
    Note over App,Backend: Token Refresh Flow
    App->>Auth: POST /auth/refresh (with refresh token)
    Auth-->>App: New access token
```

#### Authorization Framework

| Aspect | Implementation | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Access Control | Role-based | Single role (security personnel) |
| Token Validation | Signature verification | Ensure token integrity and authenticity |
| Token Claims | User ID, phone number | Identify user for operations |
| Token Expiration | Short-lived access tokens | Typically 1 hour validity |

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Limit Type | Threshold | Scope | Response |
|------------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Authentication | 5 attempts/10 minutes | Per phone number | 429 Too Many Requests |
| API Requests | 60 requests/minute | Per user | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Photo Uploads | 20 uploads/hour | Per user | 429 Too Many Requests |

Rate limit responses include Retry-After headers to indicate when the client should retry.

#### Versioning Approach

| Aspect | Implementation | Description |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Version Indicator | URL Path | /api/v1/resource |
| Compatibility | Backward compatible | New versions maintain support for old clients |
| Deprecation | Header notification | Warning header for deprecated endpoints |
| Documentation | Per-version docs | Separate documentation for each API version |

#### Documentation Standards

| Standard | Implementation | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| API Specification | OpenAPI 3.0 | Machine-readable API documentation |
| Code Comments | XML Documentation | In-code documentation for API clients |
| Status Codes | Standard HTTP codes | Consistent response status indicators |
| Error Format | Standardized JSON | Consistent error response structure |

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Mobile App] -->|Generate Event| B[API Gateway]
    B -->|Route Event| C[Event Processor]
    C -->|Store Event| D[Event Store]
    C -->|Process Event| E[Service Handler]
    E -->|Update State| F[Database]
    E -->|Generate Notification| G[Notification Service]
    G -->|Push Update| A
```

The application implements several event processing patterns:

1. **Command Pattern**: Direct requests for immediate actions (clock in/out, photo upload)
2. **Event Sourcing**: Location tracking events stored as immutable records
3. **Publish-Subscribe**: Checkpoint verifications trigger notifications to supervisors

#### Message Queue Architecture

| Queue | Purpose | Processing Pattern |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Location Updates | Buffer location data | Batch processing |
| Photo Uploads | Manage photo transmission | Sequential processing |
| Checkpoint Verifications | Track patrol progress | Priority-based processing |

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mobile Application"
        A[Location Service] -->|Queue| B[Location Queue]
        C[Photo Service] -->|Queue| D[Photo Queue]
        E[Patrol Service] -->|Queue| F[Verification Queue]
    end
    
    subgraph "Sync Service"
        G[Queue Processor]
        H[Network Monitor]
        I[Retry Handler]
    end
    
    B -->|Batch| G
    D -->|Sequential| G
    F -->|Priority| G
    
    H -->|Connectivity Status| G
    G -->|Failed Items| I
    I -->|Retry| G
    
    G -->|API Requests| J[API Service]
```

#### Stream Processing Design

The application implements stream processing for continuous location data:

1. **Data Collection**: GPS coordinates collected at regular intervals
2. **Local Buffering**: Coordinates stored in memory queue
3. **Batch Processing**: Coordinates grouped for efficient transmission
4. **Throttling**: Adaptive sampling rate based on movement and battery
5. **Compression**: Redundant points filtered before transmission

#### Batch Processing Flows

| Process | Trigger | Batch Size | Frequency |
|---------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Location Sync | Queue threshold or timer | 50 points | Every 60 seconds |
| Photo Sync | Network availability | 5 photos | When network available |
| Report Sync | Network availability | 10 reports | When network available |

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Mobile App
    participant Queue as Local Queue
    participant API as Backend API
    
    loop Location Collection
        App->>Queue: Add location point
    end
    
    Note over App,Queue: Batch Threshold Reached
    
    App->>App: Prepare batch payload
    App->>API: POST /location/batch
    API-->>App: Batch confirmation
    App->>Queue: Clear processed items
    
    Note over App,API: Error Handling
    
    App->>API: POST /location/batch
    API--xApp: Connection error
    App->>Queue: Mark batch for retry
    App->>App: Apply backoff policy
```

#### Error Handling Strategy

| Error Type | Handling Strategy | Recovery Mechanism |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Network Timeout | Exponential backoff | Retry with increasing delays |
| API Error (4xx) | Error analysis | Correct request or notify user |
| API Error (5xx) | Circuit breaker | Temporary service degradation |
| Validation Error | Local validation | Prevent invalid submissions |

The application implements a comprehensive error handling strategy:

1. **Local Validation**: Validate data before submission to reduce API errors
2. **Retry Policies**: Automatic retry for transient failures with exponential backoff
3. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent repeated calls to failing services
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Degrade gracefully when services are unavailable
5. **Error Logging**: Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### 6.3.3 EXTERNAL SYSTEMS

#### Third-party Integration Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Mobile Application"
        A[API Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        B[Authentication API]
        C[Time Tracking API]
        D[Location API]
        E[Photo API]
        F[Report API]
        G[Checkpoint API]
    end
    
    subgraph "Third-Party Services"
        H[SMS Provider]
        I[Mapping Service]
        J[Storage Service]
    end
    
    A <-->|Authentication| B
    A <-->|Clock Events| C
    A <-->|Location Data| D
    A <-->|Photos| E
    A <-->|Reports| F
    A <-->|Checkpoints| G
    
    B <--> H
    D <--> I
    E <--> J
```

The application integrates with several third-party services:

1. **SMS Provider**: For phone verification codes
2. **Mapping Service**: For map display and geolocation
3. **Storage Service**: For secure photo storage

#### Legacy System Interfaces

The application is designed to integrate with potential legacy systems through adapter patterns:

| Legacy System | Integration Method | Data Transformation |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Time Tracking Systems | API Adapter | Format conversion for clock events |
| Security Databases | ETL Process | Batch synchronization of patrol data |
| Reporting Systems | Message Queue | Asynchronous report submission |

#### API Gateway Configuration

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Mobile App] -->|HTTPS| B[API Gateway]
    
    B -->|Route| C[Authentication Service]
    B -->|Route| D[Time Tracking Service]
    B -->|Route| E[Location Service]
    B -->|Route| F[Photo Service]
    B -->|Route| G[Report Service]
    B -->|Route| H[Patrol Service]
    
    B -->|Cross-Cutting Concerns| I[Authentication]
    B -->|Cross-Cutting Concerns| J[Rate Limiting]
    B -->|Cross-Cutting Concerns| K[Logging]
    B -->|Cross-Cutting Concerns| L[Monitoring]
```

The API Gateway handles several cross-cutting concerns:

1. **Authentication**: Validate tokens for all requests
2. **Rate Limiting**: Enforce usage limits
3. **Request Routing**: Direct requests to appropriate services
4. **Logging**: Centralized request logging
5. **Monitoring**: Track API usage and performance

#### External Service Contracts

| Service | Contract Type | Documentation | Versioning |
|---------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Authentication API | REST/JSON | OpenAPI Spec | URL-based |
| Time Tracking API | REST/JSON | OpenAPI Spec | URL-based |
| Location API | REST/JSON | OpenAPI Spec | URL-based |
| Photo API | REST/Multipart | OpenAPI Spec | URL-based |
| Report API | REST/JSON | OpenAPI Spec | URL-based |

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

The Security Patrol Application implements a robust authentication framework centered around phone number verification, which provides a balance between security and usability for mobile security personnel.

#### Identity Management

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| User Identity | Phone number-based | Primary identifier for security personnel |
| Identity Verification | SMS verification code | Confirms possession of registered phone |
| Identity Storage | Backend user registry | Centralized management of authorized users |

The application does not store user credentials locally, instead relying on token-based authentication after initial verification. This approach minimizes the security risk associated with storing sensitive credentials on mobile devices that may be lost or stolen.

#### Multi-factor Authentication

The application implements a two-factor authentication approach:

1. **Something you have**: The registered phone number (verified via SMS)
2. **Something you know**: The verification code sent to that phone

This provides stronger security than single-factor approaches while maintaining usability for security personnel in the field.

#### Session Management

| Aspect | Implementation | Security Control |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Session Establishment | JWT token issuance | Created upon successful verification |
| Session Duration | Configurable expiry (default: 8 hours) | Matches typical security shift duration |
| Session Termination | Explicit logout or token expiration | Prevents unauthorized access after use |
| Session Persistence | Secure storage | Protected from unauthorized access |

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unauthenticated
    Unauthenticated --> PhoneEntry: Open App
    PhoneEntry --> VerificationPending: Submit Phone
    VerificationPending --> Authenticated: Valid Code
    VerificationPending --> VerificationPending: Invalid Code
    Authenticated --> Active: Session Valid
    Active --> SessionExpiring: Approaching Expiry
    SessionExpiring --> Active: Token Refresh
    SessionExpiring --> Unauthenticated: Refresh Failed
    Active --> Unauthenticated: Manual Logout
    Active --> Unauthenticated: Session Timeout
```

#### Token Handling

| Token Type | Purpose | Storage Location | Lifecycle |
|------------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Access Token | API authorization | Secure storage | Short-lived (8 hours) |
| Refresh Token | Obtain new access token | Secure storage | Medium-lived (30 days) |
| Verification ID | Link phone to verification code | Memory only | Very short-lived (10 minutes) |

The application implements secure token handling practices:

- Tokens stored using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms
- Tokens never exposed in logs or error messages
- Automatic token refresh when approaching expiration
- Complete token invalidation on logout

#### Authentication Flow

```mermaid

## 8. INFRASTRUCTURE

### 8.1 DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT

#### 8.1.1 Target Environment Assessment

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Environment Type | Hybrid (Mobile app with cloud backend) |
| Geographic Distribution | Mobile app distributed via app stores; Backend services in cloud region(s) closest to user base |
| Mobile Platform | Android devices via .NET MAUI |
| Backend Requirements | API services for authentication, data storage, and synchronization |

The Security Patrol Application is primarily a mobile application targeting Android devices through .NET MAUI. The application requires backend API services for authentication, data storage, and synchronization of patrol data, photos, and activity reports.

**Resource Requirements:**

| Resource Type | Minimum Requirements | Recommended |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Mobile Device | Android 8.0+, 2GB RAM, 100MB storage | Android 10.0+, 4GB RAM, 1GB storage |
| Network | 3G connectivity minimum | 4G/LTE or WiFi connectivity |
| Backend Services | Standard API hosting tier | Scalable API hosting with auto-scaling |

**Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:**

- Data privacy regulations compliance for user location data
- Secure storage of authentication information
- Encrypted transmission of all data between app and backend
- Secure storage of patrol verification data for audit purposes

#### 8.1.2 Environment Management

**Configuration Management Strategy:**

| Environment | Purpose | Configuration Approach |
|-------------|---------|------------------------|
| Development | Active development and testing | Developer-specific configurations, mock services |
| Testing | QA and integration testing | Isolated test environment with test data |
| Staging | Pre-production validation | Mirror of production with sanitized data |
| Production | Live application environment | Locked-down configuration, restricted access |

**Environment Promotion Strategy:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Development] -->|Automated Tests Pass| B[Testing]
    B -->|QA Approval| C[Staging]
    C -->|Final Validation| D[Production]
    D -->|Hotfix Needed| E[Hotfix Branch]
    E -->|Emergency Fix| B
```

**Backup and Disaster Recovery Plans:**

| Asset | Backup Frequency | Retention | Recovery Approach |
|-------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Mobile App Data | Continuous sync when online | 90 days | Automatic re-sync from backend |
| Backend Databases | Daily full, hourly incremental | 30 days | Point-in-time recovery |
| Application Code | Every commit | Indefinite | Source control restoration |
| Configuration | Every change | 90 days | Infrastructure as Code deployment |

### 8.2 CLOUD SERVICES

#### 8.2.1 Cloud Provider Selection

The backend services for the Security Patrol Application will be hosted in Microsoft Azure, selected for the following reasons:

- Native integration with .NET ecosystem
- Comprehensive security features for sensitive data
- Scalable API hosting options
- Robust authentication services
- Global presence for geographic distribution

#### 8.2.2 Core Services Required

| Service | Purpose | Tier/Version |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| Azure App Service | API hosting | Standard S1 (2 instances) |
| Azure SQL Database | Relational data storage | Standard S1 |
| Azure Blob Storage | Photo storage | Hot tier with LRS |
| Azure Key Vault | Secrets management | Standard |
| Azure Active Directory B2C | Authentication | Standard |
| Azure Application Insights | Monitoring | Basic |

#### 8.2.3 High Availability Design

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Primary Region"
        A[App Service Plan] --> B[App Service Instance 1]
        A --> C[App Service Instance 2]
        D[Azure SQL Database] --> E[Primary Database]
        F[Azure Blob Storage] --> G[LRS Storage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Secondary Region"
        H[App Service Plan] --> I[App Service Instance 1]
        H --> J[App Service Instance 2]
        K[Azure SQL Database] --> L[Geo-Replicated Database]
        M[Azure Blob Storage] --> N[Backup Storage]
    end
    
    O[Azure Traffic Manager] --> A
    O --> H
    
    P[Mobile Clients] --> O
```

The high availability design includes:

- Multiple App Service instances in each region
- Azure Traffic Manager for regional failover
- Geo-replicated SQL Database for data redundancy
- Cross-region blob storage replication for photos
- Automatic failover configuration for critical services

#### 8.2.4 Cost Optimization Strategy

| Strategy | Implementation | Estimated Savings |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Auto-scaling | Scale down during off-hours | 30-40% on compute |
| Reserved Instances | 1-year commitment for base capacity | 20-25% on committed resources |
| Storage Tiering | Move older photos to cool storage | 40-50% on storage costs |
| Performance Tier Optimization | Right-size SQL Database based on usage patterns | 15-30% on database costs |

**Estimated Monthly Costs:**

| Service | Estimated Cost (USD) |
|---------|----------------------|
| App Service | $150-$300 |
| SQL Database | $100-$200 |
| Blob Storage | $50-$150 |
| Other Services | $100-$200 |
| **Total** | **$400-$850** |

#### 8.2.5 Security and Compliance Considerations

| Security Aspect | Implementation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Data Encryption | Encryption at rest and in transit for all services |
| Network Security | Virtual Network integration, IP restrictions |
| Identity Management | Azure AD B2C with MFA for backend access |
| Secrets Management | Key Vault for all credentials and secrets |
| Compliance Monitoring | Security Center for continuous assessment |

### 8.3 CONTAINERIZATION

Containerization is not applicable for the mobile application component as it runs natively on Android devices. For the backend API services, a containerized approach is optional but not required given the selected Azure App Service deployment model.

If containerization becomes necessary in the future (for example, to support more complex backend services or improve deployment consistency), the following approach would be recommended:

- Container Platform: Docker with Azure Container Registry
- Base Images: Microsoft-provided .NET images
- Build Process: Multi-stage builds to minimize image size
- Security: Container scanning integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### 8.4 ORCHESTRATION

Full container orchestration is not required for the initial deployment of the Security Patrol Application backend services, as Azure App Service provides the necessary scaling and management capabilities for the API services.

If application complexity increases or deployment requirements change, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) would be the recommended orchestration platform, with the following configuration:

- Cluster Architecture: Multi-node cluster with system and user node pools
- Deployment Strategy: Helm charts for service definitions
- Auto-scaling: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler based on CPU/memory metrics
- Resource Allocation: Request and limits defined for all containers

| Component | Scaling Trigger | Scaling Approach |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| App Service | >70% CPU sustained | Increase instance size |
| SQL Database | >70% DTU sustained | Increase performance tier |
| Blob Storage | >80% capacity | Automatic scaling |

#### 8.11.2 Horizontal Scaling

| Component | Scaling Trigger | Scaling Approach |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| App Service | >60% CPU across instances | Add instances (auto-scale) |
| API Services | >100 req/sec per instance | Add instances (auto-scale) |

#### 8.11.3 Scaling Limits

| Resource | Minimum | Maximum | Scaling Increment |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| App Service Instances | 2 | 10 | 1 instance |
| SQL Database | S1 (20 DTU) | S3 (100 DTU) | One tier |
| Storage | 100 GB | 5 TB | 100 GB |
