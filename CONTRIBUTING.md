### Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions for bug fixes, enhancements, and new features. The process for contributing code is outlined in the following sections.

## Development Workflow

We follow a Git Flow-inspired branching strategy for development:

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code, tagged with release versions
- `develop`: Integration branch for features, primary development branch
- `feature/*`: Feature branches for new development
- `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
- `release/*`: Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches for critical production issues

Branch naming convention:
- Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/issue-description`
- Release branches: `release/vX.Y.Z`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/vX.Y.Z`

### Development Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you're an external contributor, fork the repository to your GitHub account

2. **Create a Branch**:
   ```bash
   # For features
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name develop
   
   # For bug fixes
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description develop
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Follow the coding standards and guidelines
   - Write tests for your changes
   - Keep your changes focused and related to a single issue

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   - Use the conventional commit format: `type(scope): message`
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable
   - Example: `feat(auth): implement phone verification #123`

5. **Push Your Branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**: Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch

7. **Code Review**: Address any feedback from the code review

8. **Merge**: Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `develop` branch

### Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

Commit message format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): implement phone verification

Add phone number verification using SMS codes for user authentication.
This includes the UI components, service implementation, and API integration.

Closes #123
```

## Coding Standards

We maintain high coding standards to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency. All contributions must adhere to these standards.

### General Guidelines

- Follow the SOLID principles of object-oriented design
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Keep methods and classes focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful names for variables, methods, and classes
- Add appropriate comments and documentation
- Follow consistent patterns and conventions
- Minimize code duplication (DRY principle)
- Consider performance implications, especially for mobile devices
- Follow secure coding practices

### Language-Specific Standards

- **C#**: Follow the [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- **XAML**: Follow consistent formatting and organization
- **SQL**: Use parameterized queries and follow SQL best practices

For detailed coding standards, refer to our [Coding Standards Guide](docs/development/coding-standards.md).

### Code Style and Formatting

The repository includes an `.editorconfig` file that defines code style and formatting rules. Ensure your IDE is configured to respect these settings.

Key formatting rules include:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation in C# files
- Use 2 spaces for indentation in XAML, JSON, and YAML files
- Place opening braces on a new line (Allman style)
- Limit lines to 120 characters where possible
- Use a single blank line to separate logical groups of code

### Documentation

- Use XML documentation comments for all public members
- Document classes, interfaces, methods, properties, and events
- Write clear and concise descriptions
- Document parameter validation and exceptions
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Document complex algorithms and business rules
- Add comments explaining "why" not "what"

## Testing Requirements

Testing is a critical part of our development process. All code contributions must include appropriate tests.

### Test Coverage

We aim for high test coverage, with the following minimum requirements:

- Services: 90% coverage
- ViewModels: 85% coverage
- Repositories: 80% coverage
- Helpers: 80% coverage
- Overall: 80% coverage

New features should include tests that verify the functionality works as expected. Bug fixes should include tests that verify the bug is fixed and won't regress.

### Types of Tests

The project includes several types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests**: For testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: For testing component interactions
3. **UI Tests**: For testing the user interface
4. **Performance Tests**: For testing performance characteristics
5. **Security Tests**: For testing security features

Contributions should include the appropriate types of tests based on the changes made. For detailed testing guidelines, refer to our [Testing Guidelines](docs/development/testing-guidelines.md).

### Test Organization

Tests should be organized to mirror the structure of the code being tested. Test classes should be named after the class being tested with a 'Tests' suffix.

Example:
```csharp
// Class being tested
public class AuthenticationService { ... }

// Test class
public class AuthenticationServiceTests { ... }
```

### Test Best Practices

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Write both positive and negative test cases
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario and expected outcome
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Keep tests fast and reliable
