# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the Security Patrol application, including how to report vulnerabilities, our commitment to security, and expectations for security researchers.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest major version of the Security Patrol application receives security updates. We recommend always using the most recent version to ensure you have all security patches.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Security Patrol application seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge and address your report quickly.

To report a security vulnerability, please email security@securitypatrol.example.com with the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggestions for mitigation

Please do NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly until we've had a chance to address it.

We strive to respond to security reports within 48 hours and will keep you updated as we address the issue. Depending on the severity and complexity of the vulnerability, resolution may take longer.

## Security Expectations

When investigating potential security issues in the Security Patrol application, please:

- Only test against test environments or your own installations
- Do not access, modify, or delete data that does not belong to you
- Do not attempt denial of service attacks
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Provide us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure

## Security Measures

The Security Patrol application implements several security measures to protect user data and ensure secure operation:

- **Authentication**: Phone number verification with SMS codes and JWT token-based session management
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit for all sensitive data
- **Secure Communication**: TLS 1.2+ with certificate pinning for all API communication
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and API responses
- **Secure Storage**: Platform-specific secure storage for sensitive data
- **Authorization Controls**: Role-based access control and resource-level authorization

For more detailed information about our security architecture, please refer to the documentation in the `docs/architecture/security.md` file.

## Security Testing

We conduct regular security testing of the Security Patrol application, including:

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for code analysis
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for runtime analysis
- Dependency scanning for vulnerable components
- Manual penetration testing for complex vulnerabilities
- Continuous security testing in our CI/CD pipeline

We welcome security researchers to help us identify and address security issues through responsible disclosure.

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we do recognize security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities in our security acknowledgments.

## Security Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the following security researchers for their responsible disclosures:

- This list will be updated as contributions are received.

## Security Updates

Security updates are delivered through regular application updates. We recommend configuring automatic updates to ensure you receive security patches promptly.

For critical security issues, we may release out-of-band updates and will notify users through appropriate channels.
